The new version of the FIES-CERES pipeline can handle data obtained with the new CCD installed
on 30/09/2016. For the new CCD it has only been tested with F3 and F4 data but it should work with
any fibre and binning factor. It is still able to process data obtained with the old CCD.
The long term radial velocity precision of the FIES-CERES pipeline is stull unknown because
it has not been tested with radial velocity standard starts observed at different epochs.

This version of the FIES-CERES pipeline was developed for the old CCD.
It can only process data obtained before 30/09/2016.

It has been tested for the following configurations (could work with other configurations too):
  -> med resolution fibre (F3) with 1x1 binning.
  -> med resolution fibre (F3) + ThAr comparison fibre with 1x1 binning.
  -> low resolution fibre (F1) with 2x2 binning.

For running it:

  $ python fiespipe.py <path_to_raw_data> -fibre <fibre> -binning <bin>

 + the standard CERES options.

 for example:

  $ python fiespipe.py /data/echelle/fies/raw/20160904/ -fibre F1 -binning 2 -npools 16 -do_class 
  $ python fiespipe.py /data/echelle/fies/raw/NOT_20110525_simul_thar/ -fibre F3 -binning 1 -npools 16 -do_class
